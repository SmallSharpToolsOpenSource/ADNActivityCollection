ADNActivityCollection
=====================

## UIActivities to use to share with ADN apps

Sharing messages to App.net (ADN) with apps like Netbot and Felix can help get more content
onto ADN and give users sharing options they want. This sample project will provide a collection
of activities which will detect if an ADN app is available and make it available as an option if
it is.
